# ML Onboarding Task

Welcome! This repo is part of my onboarding tasks for the machine learning track. The goal of this assignment is to help me get familiar with the basics of data manipulation and visualization in Python using Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Getting Started

To get started, I have downloaded all the necessary files locally to this repository. I have also made sure that Pandas and Matplotlib are installed on my machine.

## Assignment Task

The task for this assignment is to explore and analyze a dataset using Pandas and Matplotlib. I will need to load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, clean the data, remove any null values, and perform any necessary data transformations.

Once I have a clean dataset, I will use Matplotlib to create visualizations. I created scatter plots and histograms to gain insights into the data.

I will document my thought process and any decisions I make along the way in this README file. This will help me and others understand the reasoning behind my code and visualizations.
